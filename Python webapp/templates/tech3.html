        Ever since I started studying Software Development, Algorithms has stood out to me out of all subjects.
        It was fascinating to see how algorithms and theories can be implemented into code,
        as Iâ€™ve always felt confused about how to do so. Pseudocode was a fantastic thing to learn.
        It allows every programmer to understand each other despite the language they use, which you cannot do with spoken languages.
        It has always been a subject to look forward to where you can learn something new.
        Things like this convince me that I made the right choice choosing this career path for myself.
